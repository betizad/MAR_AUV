\begin{abstract}
	
Autonomous marine vehicles are becoming an essential tool in aquatic environmental monitoring systems, which include but not limited to data acquisition, remote sensing, and mapping
of the spatial extent of pollutant spills. In this work, we present  an unconventional bio-inspired autonomous robot aimed for execution of such tasks. Envirobot platform is based on our existing segmented    
anguilliform swimming robots, but with important adaptations in terms of energy use and efficiency, sensory decision
programming, and communication possibilities. To this end,
Envirobot has been designed to have more endurance, flexible
computational power, long range communication link, and
versatile flexible environmental sensor integration. Its low-level control is powered by an ARM processor in the head unit
and micro processors in each active module. On top of this,
integration of a computer-on-module enables versatile
high level control methods.

% This command serves to balance the column lengths

% the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
% This command does not take effect until the next page
% so it should come on the page before the last. Make
% sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
